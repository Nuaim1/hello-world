<p2>Jaguar, (Panthera onca), also called el tigre or tigre americano, largest New World member of the cat family (Felidae), once found from the U.S.-Mexican border southward to Patagonia, Argentina. Its preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions, but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts. The jaguar is virtually extinct in the northern part of its original range and survives in reduced numbers only in remote areas of Central and South America; the largest known population exists in the Amazon rainforest.Typical coloration is orange to tan, with black spots arranged in rosettes with a black spot in the centre. The jaguar resembles the leopard of Africa and Asia, but the leopard lacks the black centre spot. Along the midline of the jaguar’s back is a row of long black spots that may merge into a stripe. The base colour of the jaguar varies greatly from white to black. Although brown and black jaguars appear to be solid-coloured, spots are always faintly visible.Jaguars are also larger and more heavily built than leopards. The male jaguar, which is generally larger than the female, attains a length of 1.7–2.7 metres (5.6–9 feet), including the 0.6–0.9-metre (2–3-foot) tail, with a shoulder height of 0.7–0.8 metre (2.3–2.6 feet); it weighs from 100 to 160 kg (220 to 350 pounds). The jaguars of South America are largest.A solitary predator, the jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush hunter; its name comes from the Indian word yaguar, meaning “he who kills with one leap.” Jaguars are swift and agile and are very good climbers. They enter water freely and appear to enjoy bathing. Although active during the day, jaguars hunt mainly at night and on the ground. Capybara and peccary are their preferred prey, but they will also take deer, birds, crocodilians, and fish. Livestock are occasionally attacked in areas where ranches have replaced natural habitat. The cat is a savage fighter when cornered but does not normally attack humans.Jaguars adhere to a land tenure system much like cougars and tigers. Females establish overlapping home ranges, and female offspring may inherit land from their mothers. Males establish territories twice as large as females and overlap the ranges of several females. Both sexes mark their ranges with urine. Northern populations mate toward the end of the year, but in the tropics mating activity seems not to be restricted to a particular breeding season. After a gestation period of about 100 days, the female bears one to four tiny spotted cubs weighing 100–900 grams (less than 2 pounds) that do not open their eyes for 13 days. The mother raises the young for approximately two years. Full size and sexual maturity are reached at three to four years.The jaguar is grouped along with lions and tigers with the big, or roaring, cats and is the only such cat in the Western Hemisphere. The jaguar’s sound repertoire includes snarls, growls, and deep, hoarse grunts.</p2>

<h4 style="color:blue;">Cheetah</h4>
<img src="Cheetah.jpg" width="15%">
</div1>
<div2>
<p3>Cheetah, (Acinonyx jubatus), one of the world’s most-recognizable cats, known especially for its speed. Cheetahs’ sprints have been measured at a maximum of 114 km (71 miles) per hour, and they routinely reach velocities of 80–100 km per hour while pursuing prey. Nearly all the cheetahs remaining in the wild live in Africa.Cheetahs are covered almost entirely with small black spots on a background of pale yellow and have a white underbelly. Their faces are distinguished by prominent black lines that curve from the inner corner of each eye to the outer corners of the mouth, like a well-worn trail of inky tears. Cheetahs have a long, slender body measuring 1.2 metres (4 feet), with a long tail (65–85 cm [2–3 feet]) that generally ends in a white tuft. They are about 75 cm tall at the shoulder. Weight ranges from 34 to 54 kg (75 to 119 pounds), males being slightly larger than females.Cheetahs have evolved many adaptations that enhance their ability to sprint. Their legs are proportionally longer than those of other big cats; an elongated spine increases stride length at high speeds; they have unretractable claws, special paw pads for extra traction, and a long tail for balance. Internally, the liver, adrenal glands, lungs, bronchi, nasal passages, and heart are all large to allow intense physiological activity. During a chase, cheetahs take about 31/2 strides per second and 60 to 150 breaths per minute. Chases are usually limited to sprints of less than 200–300 metres, however, because the increased physiological activity associated with running creates heat faster than it can be released through evaporative cooling (sweating through their paws and panting).Unlike most carnivores, cheetahs are active mainly during the day, hunting in the early morning and late afternoon. A cheetah eats a variety of small animals, including game birds, rabbits, small antelopes (including the springbok, impala, and gazelle), young warthogs, and larger antelopes (such as the kudu, hartebeest, oryx, and roan). Prey is generally consumed quickly to avoid losing it to competitors such as lions, leopards, jackals, and hyenas.Cheetahs inhabit a wide variety of habitats, including the dry, open country and grasslands where they are most often seen, as well as areas of denser vegetation and rocky upland terrain. Groups consist of a mother and her young or of coalitions made up of two or three males that are often brothers. Adult males and females rarely meet except to mate. Male coalitions live and hunt together for life and occupy an area that may overlap the range of several adult females. Female home ranges are generally much larger than those of male coalitions.Following a gestation period of three months, the female gives birth to two to eight cubs, usually in an isolated spot hidden in the cover of tall grass or thicker vegetation. At birth, cubs weigh about 250 to 300 grams (slightly more than half a pound). Their fur is dark and includes a thick yellowish gray mane along the back, a trait that presumably offers better camouflage and increased protection from high temperatures during the day and low temperatures at night during the first few months of life. Mortality among young cubs can be as high as 90 percent in the wild, often because of other predators. The mother leaves her offspring when they are 16–24 months old. Young males are chased away by the resident male coalition, traveling several hundred kilometres before establishing residence and becoming sexually active at 21/2 to 3 years of age. Female offspring will generally inhabit the same vicinity as their mother. Life expectancy of cheetahs is about 7 years in the wild and generally from 8 to 12 years in captivity.</p3>

<h4 style="color:Blue;">Wildcat</h4>
<img src="Wildcat.jpg" width="15%">
</div1>
<div2>
<p4>Wildcat, (species Felis silvestris), a small wild member of the cat family (Felidae) native to Eurasia and Africa. There are some three to five subspecies. The name wildcat is also used as a general term for feral domestic cats and for any of the smaller wild species of the cat family.The nominate subspecies, the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris), inhabits forested regions from Scotland through continental Europe to western Asia. It is similar to the domestic cat but has longer legs, a larger, flatter head, and a full, relatively short tail ending in a rounded (not pointed) tip. The coat is yellowish gray with dark stripes and bands in the striped tabby pattern; the tail is black-ringed. The adult wildcat is 50 to 80 cm (20 to 32 inches) long, excluding a 25- to 35-cm (10- to 14-inch) tail; it stands 35–40 cm (14–16 inches) high at the shoulder and weighs from 3 to 10 kg (6.6 to 22 pounds).

The European wildcat is a solitary, nocturnal animal that preys on birds and small mammals. It breeds once yearly (in spring) in continental Europe and twice (sometimes three times) yearly in Scotland. A litter consists of three to six kittens; the gestation period is 68 days. The wildcat interbreeds with the domestic cat. Certain authorities believe that the purity of the Scottish wildcat (one of the several races) is being threatened by interbreeding.The subspecies known as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), native to northern Africa, is the putative ancestor of the domestic cat. The Asian wildcat (Felis silvestris ornata) ranges east of the Caspian Sea into China.</p4>

<h4 style="color:Blue;">Florida Panther</h4>
<img src="panther-member-Florida-population-hardwood-forests-cougar.jpg" width="20%">
</div1>
<div2>
<p5>Florida panther, member of a population of large New World cats belonging to the species Puma concolor, family Felidae, confined to a small, isolated, and inbred group in southern Florida. This population is the only breeding group of pumas in the eastern United States. The Florida panther was traditionally classified as a distinct subspecies of puma (P. concolor coryi) and was reclassified as a population of the P. concolor couguar subspecies in 2017 after a genetic analysis. The Florida panther was one of the first animals listed under the Endangered Species Act when the law first passed in 1973, and it is recognized as the state animal of Florida.Florida panthers live in subtropical environments and frequently pass through wetlands, forests, and grasslands in search of food. They can use human paths and often cross roads and highways. Although the population is now confined exclusively to southern Florida, its geographic range once extended northward as far as Tennessee and South Carolina and westward as far as Arkansas and Louisiana.

The fur of adult animals is dark buff, tawny, or rust-coloured above, brownish orange to light brown or tawny on the sides, and light buff to white on the undersides. Most male Florida panthers are relatively large, weighing 45–72 kg (100–160 pounds); females weigh 30–45 kg (65–100 pounds). From nose to tail, adults measure 1.8–2.1 metres (6–7 feet). Kittens are buff with dark brown or blackish spots and weigh 0.5 kg (1 pound) at birth.The preferred prey of Florida panthers is white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus); however, they also hunt smaller animals—such as wild hogs, rabbits, birds, and raccoons (Procyon lotor)—and larger ones, such as the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). Florida panthers are threatened by various forms of human disturbance, including habitat fragmentation and degradation. Several perish each year in collisions with automobiles or other vehicles. In addition, some ecologists fear that the Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus), an invasive species that competes with the Florida panther for prey, is reducing prey populations and thus contributing to increased panther mortality.In 1900 the Florida panther population was estimated at about 500 individuals. By 1967 the population had fallen to 12–20 adults because of hunting and the clearing of the animal’s natural habitat for agricultural use. That year the animal was listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as threatened with extinction, and in 1973 it was added to the U.S. endangered species list. Since then, conservation programs, including one that supplemented the population with eight female pumas from Texas in 1995, have resulted in a steady increase in Florida panther numbers. In the 2010s the Florida panther population was estimated at more than 200.</p5>

<h4 style="color:Blue">Longhair</h4>
<img src="Persian-cream-bicolour.jpg" width="20%">
</div1>
<div2>
<p6>Longhair, also called Persian, breed of domestic cat noted for its long, soft, flowing coat. Long-haired cats were originally known as Persians or Angoras. These names were later discarded in favour of the name longhair, although the cats are still commonly called Persians in the United States. The longhair, a medium-sized or large cat with a cobby (stocky), short-legged body, has a broad, round head, a snub nose, and a short, heavily haired tail. The large, round eyes may be blue, orange, golden, green, or copper-coloured, depending on the colour of the cat. The soft, finely textured coat forms a heavy ruff about the neck.The longhair is bred in a number of colour varieties. The solid, or self, colours are white, black, blue, red, and cream. Patterned coats include shaded silver and black (smoke); silver, brown, blue, or red with darker markings (tabby); white finely ticked with black (chinchilla); cream, red, and black (tortoiseshell); calico, or tortoiseshell and white; blue-gray and cream intermingled (blue cream); and bicoloured. The colours of tortoiseshells, calicos, and blue creams are genetically linked with the sex of the cat. Almost all are females, and most of the few males are sterile. Blue-eyed white cats may be deaf.

Longhairs with Siamese markings (i.e., pale body and dark face, ears, legs, and tail) are Himalayans, or colourpoints. Similarly marked longhairs with white paws are called Birmans. Peke-faced longhairs have short, pushed-in, Pekingese-like faces.Longhair cats, although generally considered more languorous than short-haired cats, are, like shorthairs, noted for playfulness, affection, and the ability to defend themselves if necessary.</p6>

<h4 style="color:blue">Snow Leopard</h4>
<img src="334032.jpg" width="20%">
</div1>
<div2>
<p7>Snow leopard, also called ounce, large long-haired Asian cat, classified as either Panthera uncia or Uncia uncia in the family Felidae. The snow leopard inhabits the mountains of central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, ranging from an elevation of about 1,800 metres (about 6,000 feet) in the winter to about 5,500 metres (18,000 feet) in the summer.Its soft coat, consisting of a dense insulating undercoat and a thick outercoat of hairs about 5 cm (2 inches) long, is pale grayish with dark rosettes and a dark streak along the spine. The underparts, on which the fur may be 10 cm (4 inches) long, are uniformly whitish. The snow leopard attains a length of about 2.1 metres (7 feet), including the 0.9-metre- (3-foot-) long tail. It stands about 0.6 metre (2 feet) high at the shoulder and weighs 23–41 kg (50–90 pounds). It hunts at night and preys on various animals, such as marmots, wild sheep, ibex (Capra), and domestic livestock. Its litters of two to four young are born after a gestation period of approximately 93 days.</p7>
<p8>Formerly classified as Leo uncia, the snow leopard has been placed—with the lion, tiger, and other big cats—in the genus Panthera. Because of the presence of certain skeletal features, such as having a shorter skull and having more-rounded eye orbits than other big cats, the snow leopard has also been classified by some authorities as the sole member of the genus Uncia. Genetic studies show that the common ancestor of snow leopards and tigers diverged from the lineage of big cats about 3.9 million years ago and that snow leopards branched from tigers about 3.2 million years ago.Between 1986 and 2017 the snow leopard was listed as an endangered species on the Red List of Threatened Species from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, in 2017 the species’ status was changed to “vulnerable” after a population calculation error was discovered in the species’ 2008 population assessment. Between 2,500 to 10,000 adult snow leopards remain in the wild, but the species continues to face daunting threats to its survival.</p8>
<p9>Several factors have contributed to their decline. Their wild prey has decreased as herding and ranching activities have expanded throughout their geographic range. They are often killed by herders and ranchers whose livestock they have taken, and their bones and hides are sought after by hunters and poachers for the illegal animal trade.</p9>
